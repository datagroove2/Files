In February 2018, the diet and exercise service MyFitnessPal suffered a data breach.
The incident exposed 144 million unique email addresses alongside usernames, IP addresses
and passwords stored as SHA-1 and bcrypt hashes (the former for earlier accounts, the latter
for newer accounts). In 2019, the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace
(along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly.

Last June of 2019 a dehashed version of this database started circulating.
After verifying the data the info is correct and valid.
