In March 2012, the music website Last.fm was hacked and 43 million user accounts were exposed.
Whilst Last.fm knew of an incident back in 2012, the scale of the hack was not known until the
data was released publicly in September 2016. The breach includes 37 million unique email
addresses, usernames and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes.
